# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:

```

#Program to to find the Exponentiation of a number.
#Developed by: Sudharshna Lakshmi.S
#RegisterNumber: 21500166
def exponentiation():
    a=int(input())
    b=(a**2)
    print("Exponentiation of a given number:",b)
exponentiation()

```

## Output:
